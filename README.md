My evolving Python sandbox.  
Just exploring. Just learning. Just vibing.  
Projects, patterns, randomness, dinosaurs.  


Python logic, cryptic randomness, UI doodles, object-y spellsâ€”whatever Iâ€™m curious about lands here.  
Some folders are complete. Some are chaos. Some are just for fun.  
This is a growing collection of learning moments, one project at a time.

>ğŸ¦• **Want a prehistoric hello?**

Run this to summon a colorful dino splash screen:

```bash
pip install colorama
python ascii_dino.py
```

<br>

## ğŸš€ How to Run the Projects

Most folders contain a single Python file like `tip.py`, `hangman.py`, or `calculator.py`.  
To run any project locally:

```bash
python filename.py
```

Some folders include helper modules (like art.py, logo.py, or data.py) that are imported into a main file.
In these cases, navigate into the folder and run the entry point fileâ€”usually something like main.py or blackjack.py.

```bash
cd "06-Blind Auction Project"
python main.py
```
